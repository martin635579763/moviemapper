# **App Name**: SeatLayout

## Core Features:

- Layout Editor: A grid-based editor for designing the seating layout, with options to add, remove, and modify seats. Different sections within the grid are allowed to represent aisles, screens, etc.
- Load Layouts: Allow users to load pre-existing layouts.
- Export Layouts: Allow users to persist a layout once editing is complete. Layouts may have identifying name and metadata, but the application itself does not persist these values.
- Layout Preview: Display a dynamic preview of the seating arrangement. A 'simulation' mode shows which seats are in view of the screen. Another mode allows rendering seat views that are occluded by others.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey a sense of depth and cinematic space, drawing inspiration from a darkened theater.
- Background color: Dark gray (#333333), emulating the darkened environment of a cinema, to help the seat selections pop out.
- Accent color: A vibrant amber (#FFB300) to highlight selected seats and interactive elements.
- Clear, sans-serif font for readability within the layout editor and for labeling seats.
- Simple, geometric icons representing seats, aisles, and screen areas within the editor.
- The grid layout should allow responsive resizing, allowing seat visualizations for any screen sizes.
